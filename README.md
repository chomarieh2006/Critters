This project was focused on developing code to simulate critters in a 2D world, where each critter‬
‭ follows specific behaviors and interacts with other species. Through the implementation of‬
‭ algorithms for critter movement and interaction, I explored reading and executing behavior‬
‭ instructions, utilizing API documentation, and testing if the methods are runnable/running as‬
‭ intended in a controlled simulation. By the end of the lab, I successfully developed a fully‬
‭ functioning simulation of diverse critter behavior.‬

My critter (under‬‭ Xie.cri‬‭ ) works similarly to the‬‭ given‬‭ FlyTrap‬‭, but instead of spinning in place,‬
‭ it is always against a wall and hops only when there's an immediate threat. This predictable‬
‭ movement in response to threats is more efficient than‬‭ Rover’s‬‭ use of random movement which‬
‭ is less focused and makes it more vulnerable to being infected. Furthermore, by only infecting‬
‭ enemies rather than eating them, our critter can neutralize enemies and spread its influence.‬
‭ Infecting converts enemies into allies, giving it a clear advantage.‬‭ Rover‬‭, by alternating between‬
‭ infecting and eating, doesn’t offer the same benefits. This strategy allowed my critter to overtake‬
‭ Rover‬‭ even when the numbers were substantially unbalanced‬‭ (ex: 30‬‭ Xie‬‭ vs 300‬‭ Rover‬‭ ).‬
